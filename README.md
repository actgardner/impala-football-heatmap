impala-football-heatmap
=======================

A simple Ruby/Impala demo visualizing the DEB Grand Challenge 2013 Football data

#Requirements

You must have a Hadoop cluster, with Hive and Impala configured. You can use the [Cloudera Impala Demo VM](https://ccp.cloudera.com/display/SUPPORT/Cloudera\'s+Impala+Demo+VM), which has everything pre-configured, to get test it out on a single machine.

#To Use

Grab the [DEB grand challenge sensor data](http://www.orgs.ttu.edu/debs2013/index.php), and sensors.csv from this repo.

In a Hive shell, define the tables and load the data:

    CREATE TABLE soccer ( sid int, ts bigint, x double, y double, z double, v double, a double, vx double, vy double, vz double, ax double, ay double, az double ) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',';
    CREATE TABLE sensors ( sid int, sensor_position string, team string, player_type string, player_name string ) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',';
    LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH 'full-game' INTO TABLE soccer;
    LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH 'sensors.csv' INTO TABLE sensors;

In web.rb configure IMPALA_SERVER to point to an Impala daemon on your cluster.

Start the server with 'sudo ruby web.rb'.

#Partitioning

To partition on the sensor id, which speeds up the queries a bit, you can run the following:

    SET hive.exec.dynamic.partition=true;
    SET hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode=nonstrict;
    CREATE TABLE soccer_part (ts bigint, x double, y double, z double, v double, a double, vx double, vy double, vz double, ax double, ay double, az double) PARTITIONED BY (sid int) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',';
    INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE soccer_part PARTITION(sid) select ts,x,y,z,v,a,vx,vy,vz,ax,ay,az,sid from soccer;

You'll have to update the query in web.rb to use the partitioned table, as well.

#Thanks

To put this together quickly, we used [spin.js](http://fgnass.github.com/spin.js/) for the loading spinner and [heatmap.js](http://www.patrick-wied.at/static/heatmapjs/) to draw the heatmap. 

On the backend, Colin Marc's [impala-ruby](https://github.com/colinmarc/impala-ruby) was essential
